Elsen (OFF)
-------------------

The official SSP Ghost for everyone's favourite NPCs of OFF, the Elsen! This stuttering Elsen in particular is one who works in Zone 1 - more specifically, Alma. That doesn't mean he doesn't know about other Zones and whatnot.

Unlike most other ghosts, this Elsen is not too estatic about being here. He gets stressed out easily and has a need for sugar. So it's your job now to care for him and make sure nothing bad happens!
He has a hidden stress and sugar level that you need to manage to ensure that he stays happy and healthy. If you go too long without caring for his needs, there may be no way to go back without consequences...

This Elsen has a good few unique features, such as: 
- Using Wide Angle to see how the Elsen is doing
- Asking him questions
- Say stuff to him
- Using/giving items
- Shopping for said items using Credits that you can obtain in multiple ways
- Play an OFF-related quiz
- Play, play, play the Balloon Game!

And perhaps more hidden features!


But like all ghosts, this Elsen can also do more cool stuff, such as:
- Check your email
- Check for updates
- Empty your recycling bin
- Open a calender

And probably more!

You can gain Credits by just simply keeping the Elsen up for long enough, playing games, or just by pure luck. You'll definitely need these Credits to buy the things that'll keep this Elsen in check.

However, if you don't feel like tending to his needs, or you just flat out don't want to, you can always pause all progression and turn him into a normal, more passive ghost.

Also, here are some helpful hotkeys you can use:
r - Repeats normal dialogue
t - Says normal dialogue
f1 - Opens this very ReadMe!

CREDITS:

Mortis Ghost - Obviously for making the game that is OFF

Zarla - For making the basic SSP Ghost template and being the reason English ghosts are in production today, along with the code for an ukagaka to recognize certain windows

Erin - For making the SSP OFF Balloon. I made tweaks and adjustments to fit this ghost, but she was the original
